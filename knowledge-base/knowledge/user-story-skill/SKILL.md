# SKILL: User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

**Trigger:** Write / draft / review / decompose / check User Stories or AC.
**Rule:** Read fully before producing any output.

---

## 1 · STORY FORMAT (Non-Negotiable)

```text
As a [specific Actor/Persona],
I want to [Action + Object],
so that [Value/Reason].
```

| Part | Guidance |
|------|----------|
| **WHO** (Actor) | Specific named persona — never "user", "system", or "developer". Represents how the person works, thinks, feels. One actor per story. |
| **DOES + WHAT** (Action) | Outcome-focused, implementation-free. No UI elements, no technical prescriptions. Use "I want to [do X]" — avoid "I need a [feature]". |
| **WHY** (so that) | Genuine user/business value — never a system requirement. Always present. Ask "Why?" 5× to reach true motivation. |
| **DONE WHEN** (AC) | Testable conditions confirming the story is complete. See Section 3. |

---

## 2 · INVEST (validate before every story)

| | Criterion | Check |
|-|-----------|-------|
| **I** | Independent | Stands alone; no dependency on incomplete stories |
| **N** | Negotiable | Starting point for discussion, not a locked contract |
| **V** | Valuable | Delivers real value to user or business |
| **E** | Estimable | Team can size it; if not → clarify or split |
| **S** | Small | Built + tested within one sprint (≤ 3 dev days) |
| **T** | Testable | Every AC has a clear pass/fail condition |

---

## 3 · ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (AC)

**Format:** `Done when: [testable condition — pass/fail verifiable]`
**Prefer** "Done when" over Gherkin (Given/When/Then) — simpler to read and test.

### Must cover all of these

| Type | Rule |
|------|------|
| **Happy path** | At least one AC for the main successful flow |
| **Negative/edge flows** | `Done when: If [X], then [Y]` — at least one error/edge case |
| **Role-based** | Separate AC per role if multiple actors — only combine if buildable + testable together |
| **NFRs** | Performance, capacity, security — use exact thresholds, never vague quantifiers |
| **Design hints** | Framed as preference: `Done when: Report is exportable. (Customer prefers Excel.)` |

### NFR placement

1. In the **WHAT** clause (if it defines system behaviour)
2. In **AC** (preferred — for performance, capacity, security)
3. As its **own story** if effort is sprint-sized

### MoSCoW for AC priority

**M**ust / **S**hould / **C**ould / **W**on't — if an AC is Could/Won't, break it into a separate "Nice to Have" story rather than mixing priorities.

---

## 4 · ACTOR RULES

- Single actor, single action, single outcome per story
- If multiple roles share the same functionality: one story + role-based AC **only if** buildable AND testable together; otherwise → separate stories

---

## 5 · WHEN TO SPLIT A STORY

Split when any of these are true:

- `and` / `or` / `/` in the story statement
- AC list spans more than one sprint
- Multiple actors need separate build + test paths
- NFR effort is significant enough to own a sprint slot
- Story points = XL

**Strategies:** Part 1/2/3 · Split by actor · Split by flow (positive vs. edge) · Split by CRUD scope (Create / Edit / Delete)

---

## 6 · HIERARCHY

```text
Epic → Feature → User Story
```

- Stories must connect to a Feature; Features to an Epic
- Each story's "Why" must be **self-contained** — repeat Epic context in the story; devs work from stories, not Epics

---

## 7 · SPECIAL CASES

**API stories**

```text
As the [API name], I want to include [data] in the response,
so that [consumer] can [outcome].
```

Also define: endpoints, who pulls/publishes data, how data is used.

**Reporting stories:** WHO = person who uses the report · WHAT/AC = fields, data types · WHY = business reason

**Non-collocated teams:** Add more AC detail; supplement with SRD or mockup; link all artifacts explicitly in the story.

**Mockups:** Each mockup section → one or more stories. Developed collaboratively. Suggestion tool only — not a locked design.

---

## 8 · ANTI-PATTERNS

| ❌ Anti-Pattern | Problem | ✅ Fix |
|-----------------|---------|--------|
| "I need a [feature]" | Leads to design requirements | Use "I want to [action]" |
| "and/or/" in statement | Multiple outcomes | Split story |
| Multiple actors, one story | Can't build+test together | Separate stories |
| Prescribes UI/technical solution | Limits team creativity | Describe user goal only |
| Generic actor ("user", "system", "developer") | No empathy or end-user value | Use specific persona |
| AC list too long | Spans multiple sprints | Split story |
| Vague NFR ("more than X") | Untestable | Use exact threshold |
| Developer as actor | No end-user value | Reframe as technical task |
| Missing "so that" | Team doesn't know the why | Always include value clause |

---

## 9 · OUTPUT FORMAT

```text
## User Story
**Title:** [Short descriptive title]

As a [Actor],
I want to [Action + Object],
so that [Value].

## Acceptance Criteria
Done when: [positive condition]
Done when: [positive condition]
Done when: If [X], then [Y]  ← negative/edge case
Done when: [NFR with exact threshold]
